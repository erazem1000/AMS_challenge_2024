# Qualitative Results of uniGradICON

## ACDC Dataset
We evaluated the performance of uniGradICON on the [ACDC dataset](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/) <sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> by registering the MRIs from the first time point to all subsequent time points. As an example, we've included the target images and the corresponding warped images below.

## DirLab 4DCT Dataset
We evaluated the performance of uniGradICON on the [4DCT dataset](https://med.emory.edu/departments/radiation-oncology/research-laboratories/deformable-image-registration/index.html) <sup>[[2]](#2)</sup> by registering the CTs from the first time point to all subsequent time points. As an example, we've included the target images and the corresponding warped images below.
